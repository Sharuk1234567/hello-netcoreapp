  # As of 2017-05-17, if you don't set a tag, AppVeyor will create a tag for you,
  # which can lead to a loop of tags and builds + deploys if your deployment condition is
  # "appveyor_repo_tag: true".
  # For example, when pushing the tag "v0.1.0", it will lead to:
  # > Creating "hello-netcoreapp v0.1.0" release for repository
  # > "philippgille/hello-netcoreapp" tag "hello-netcoreapp-v0.1.0" commit "123..."...
  # And the new tag will lead to another build + deploy + new tag.
  tag: $(APPVEYOR_REPO_TAG_NAME)
  release: hello-netcoreapp $(APPVEYOR_REPO_TAG_NAME)

  draft: false
  # True here, so that we can move the v0.1.0 tag and update the existing release.
  # This repo can and should be used as a template, and v0.1.0 should be the starting point.
  # But when you fork this repository, you should set it to false, to be forced to create new tags
  # so that you have a release history on GitHub, for example so that customers
  # can report a bug in a release and you can figure out which tag that was.
